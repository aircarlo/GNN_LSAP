# GNN_LSAP


This repository will contain the Python implementation of the framework described in: [Tackling the Linear Sum Assignment Problem with Graph Neural Networks](http://) - _Carlo Aironi, Samuele Cornell, and Stefano Squartini_, where Linear Sum Assignment Problems of different dimensions are faced with a data-driven approach based on Graph Neural Networks, and accuracy is compared against two existing DNN-based approaches.
